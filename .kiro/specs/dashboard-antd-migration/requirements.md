# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing AIOM Dashboard from a custom Tailwind CSS-based UI to Ant Design (antd) components. The migration aims to modernize the user interface, improve consistency, reduce custom CSS maintenance, and leverage Ant Design's comprehensive component ecosystem while preserving all existing functionality and business logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the existing dashboard to use Ant Design components, so that I can leverage a mature design system and reduce custom UI maintenance overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use Ant Design components for all UI elements
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain intact and working
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL maintain the same routing structure and navigation patterns
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all forms SHALL use Ant Design form components with proper validation
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all data tables SHALL use Ant Design Table component with existing features (sorting, filtering, pagination)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the migrated dashboard to maintain all current features and workflows, so that my existing processes are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the Customer module THEN I SHALL be able to view, create, edit, delete, and import customers as before
2. WHEN using the Product module THEN I SHALL be able to manage products, print barcodes, and import product data as before
3. WHEN using the Supplier module THEN I SHALL be able to manage supplier information and relationships as before
4. WHEN using the Receipt modules THEN I SHALL be able to create, check, and return receipts with all existing functionality
5. WHEN using the Inventory module THEN I SHALL be able to view analysis reports and inventory data as before
6. WHEN using the User module THEN I SHALL be able to manage user accounts and permissions as before

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use the dashboard effectively on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard on mobile devices THEN all components SHALL be responsive and usable
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard on tablet devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard on desktop THEN all features SHALL be fully accessible
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible
5. WHEN using screen readers THEN all content SHALL be properly labeled and accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migrated codebase to follow Ant Design best practices and patterns, so that the code is maintainable and follows established conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing components THEN they SHALL follow Ant Design's component composition patterns
2. WHEN implementing forms THEN they SHALL use Ant Design's Form component with proper field validation
3. WHEN implementing layouts THEN they SHALL use Ant Design's Layout components (Header, Sider, Content, Footer)
4. WHEN implementing navigation THEN it SHALL use Ant Design's Menu component
5. WHEN implementing modals and drawers THEN they SHALL use Ant Design's Modal and Drawer components

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain consistent theming and branding, so that the visual identity is preserved during the migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL maintain the current color scheme and branding
2. WHEN switching between light and dark modes THEN the theme SHALL be applied consistently across all Ant Design components
3. WHEN viewing different modules THEN the visual consistency SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN interacting with components THEN they SHALL follow the established design patterns
5. WHEN customizing Ant Design themes THEN the changes SHALL be applied globally and consistently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the existing state management and API integration, so that the backend integration remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all Redux slices SHALL continue to work without modification
2. WHEN making API calls THEN all existing API endpoints and data structures SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN managing application state THEN the Redux Toolkit patterns SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN the existing auth flow SHALL continue to work
5. WHEN managing routing THEN React Router configuration SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing third-party integrations to continue working, so that features like charts, maps, and file handling are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing charts THEN ApexCharts integration SHALL continue to work within Ant Design components
2. WHEN using file uploads THEN React Dropzone SHALL integrate properly with Ant Design Upload components
3. WHEN using date pickers THEN the functionality SHALL be migrated to Ant Design DatePicker
4. WHEN printing reports THEN React-to-Print SHALL continue to work with the new components
5. WHEN using internationalization THEN i18next SHALL continue to work with Ant Design components

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be completed in phases, so that the development process is manageable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the migration THEN the project structure SHALL be set up with proper Ant Design configuration
2. WHEN migrating components THEN each module SHALL be migrated independently and tested
3. WHEN completing each phase THEN the application SHALL remain functional and deployable
4. WHEN integrating migrated components THEN they SHALL work seamlessly with existing non-migrated components
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all custom Tailwind components SHALL be replaced with Ant Design equivalents
